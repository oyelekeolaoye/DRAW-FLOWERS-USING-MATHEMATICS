# DRAW-FLOWERS-USING-MATHEMATICS
Creating flower-shaped images using math &amp; ggplot2

This is a part of DataCamp's structured projects. It aims to show the capability of the ggplot2 library to create beautiful artworks.
I haven't coded in R in a while mostly because I've been trying to improve my Python fluency. It was fun to code in the R language again and using one of the most import libraries in R of the present day (ggplot2). This project uses the 'theme' function of the ggplot2 library extensively in creating custom plots.

Have fun reading!
